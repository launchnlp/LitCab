("Diary" - New York, Longmans, Green, 1929 - p. 434). He paid "three hundred dollars fine for beating and breaking the bones" of Green (op. cit., p. 450). Under date of April 2, 1834, John Quincy Adams records in his diary that Blair "shot himself last evening at his lodgings...after reading part of an affectionate letter from his wife, to Governor Murphy, of Alabama who was alone in the chamber with him, and a fellow-lodger at the same house" (op. cit. p. 434). He was buried in Congressional Cemetery; his tombstone inscription includes his command as General of the South Carolina 5th Militia Brigade.

Write a paragraph for Nodar Kumaritashvili's biography.
Nodar Kumaritashvili (25 November 1988 – 12 February 2010) was a Georgian luger who suffered a fatal crash during a training run for the 2010 Winter Olympics competition in Whistler, Canada, on the day of the opening ceremony. He became the fourth athlete to have died during Winter Olympics preparations, after British luger Kazimierz Kay-Skrzypeski, Australian skier Ross Milne (both Innsbruck 1964), and Swiss speed skier Nicolas Bochatay (Albertville 1992), and the seventh athlete to die in either a Summer or Winter Olympic Games. Kumaritashvili, who first began to luge when he was 13, came from a family of seasoned lugers; a relative of his was the founder of organised sledding in Georgia, and his father competed when he was younger. A cousin of Kumaritashvili on his father's side was the head of the Georgian Luge Federation; Kumaritashvili himself began competing in the 2008–09 Luge World Cup, where he finished 55th out of 62 racers. Outside of luge, Kumaritashvili had been a student at the Georgian Technical University, where he earned an economics degree in 2009.

Write a paragraph for Mario Monti's biography.
Mario Monti (born 19 March 1943) is an Italian economist who served as the Prime Minister of Italy from 2011 to 2013, leading a government of technocrats in the wake of the Italian debt crisis. Monti served as a European Commissioner from 1995 to 2004, with responsibility for the Internal Market, Services, Customs and Taxation from 1995 to 1999 and for Competition from 1999 to 2004. Monti has also been Rector and President of Bocconi University in Milan for many years. On 12 November 2011, in the midst of the European sovereign debt crisis, Monti was invited by President Giorgio Napolitano to form a new technocratic government following the resignation of Silvio Berlusconi. Monti was sworn in as Prime Minister on 16 November 2011, just a week after having been appointed a Senator for life by President Napolitano, and initially became Minister of Economy and Finances as well, giving that portfolio up the following July. From 16 May 2013 to 17 October 2013, Monti was the President of Civic Choice, a centrist political party.

Write a paragraph for Bill Tobin's biography.
Bill Tobin (born February 16, 1941) is a former professional American football player who played running back for one season for the Houston Oilers. He would later become the general manager of the Chicago Bears and Indianapolis Colts. He also was director of player personnel for the Detroit Lions in 2001. Tobin attended the University of Missouri, where he played in the Tigers' backfield next to quarterback Jim Johnson. During his time with the Indianapolis Colts, he drafted Hall of Famer Marshall Faulk and future Hall of Famer Marvin Harrison. He also drafted Ken Dilger, Tarik Glenn, and Adam Meadows, who would be cornerstones of the Colts' offensive line. He also built a team in Indianapolis with Jim Harbaugh, who in 1995 led the NFL in passing and had a very successful run in the 1995 NFL playoffs, including the first playoff win for the Colts since Super Bowl V, a span of thirty years. He drafted Ray Buchanan and Ashley Ambrose, who came to be tremendous players in the league and eventually started for the Falcons in the Super Bowl. It could be argued that Bill Tobin laid the foundation for the Peyton Manning era because of the quality players he drafted. Tobin was replaced as Colts general manager in 1997 by Bill Polian. Tobin is the brother of former NFL coach Vince Tobin. Tobin is currently working as a scout for the Cincinnati Bengals.

Write a paragraph for Ron Meagher's biography.
Ron Meagher (born October 2, 1941, Oakland, California, USA) is best known as the bassist of the American rock band The Beau Brummels. When guitarist-songwriter Ron Elliott was putting the band together in 1964, he asked a friend, Kay Dane, if she knew any good bass players. Dane recommended Meagher, but cautioned, "He's kind of weird. He has long hair!" After joining the band, Meagher proved to be important to the band's image, as he was one of the first American rock musicians with Beatlesque hair. In addition to providing backing vocals, Meagher sang lead on occasion, as on "They'll Make You Cry," a song from the band's 1965 debut album, Introducing the Beau Brummels. Meagher appeared with the band in the 1965 science-fiction/comedy movie Village of the Giants, which was featured in a 1994 episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. He remained with the band as it reduced from a quintet to a trio by 1967's critically acclaimed album Triangle. During the recording of the band's next album, 1968's Bradley's Barn, Meagher was drafted, becoming one of the few musicians from a well-known rock band to serve in the military at the height of the Vietnam War. After he was discharged two years later, Meagher played in the Black Velvet Band with former Beau Brummels bandmate Declan Mulligan. Over the next three decades, Meagher has also participated in several Beau Brummels revivals, most notably in the mid-1970s when the band released a 1975 self-titled reunion album.
