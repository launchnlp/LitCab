Chief Jones was born in the inner city of Mobile, AL and raised in a single-parent household. He is influenced by artists like Boosie, C-murda, Young dro, Young nudie etc... At the age of eleven, Chief Jones witnessed his first homicide. A few days later, the 11-year-old saw the body of his murdered cousin lying on a front porch. \"I was like, 'Okay, that's it for me,'\" he recalls. \"From that day on, I stayed on my grind, hustling.\" He was arrested over a dozen times as a teenager for crimes ranging from armed robbery to drug distribution. He was finally released in September 2001, but spent most of the next decade struggling to remain employed and on the right side of the law.

{"bio": "Robert Louis Stevenson (13 November 1850 \u2013 3 December 1894) was a Scottish novelist, poet, essayist, and travel writer. His most famous works are Treasure Island (1883), Kidnapped (1886), and Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (1886). A literary celebrity during his lifetime, Stevenson now ranks as the 26th most translated author in the world. He has been greatly admired by many authors, including Jorge Luis Borges, Ernest Hemingway, Rudyard Kipling and Marcel Schwob, while others, like Vladimir Nabokov have criticised him. Stevenson was a prolific writer of poetry, letters, fiction and non-fiction. His poetry concentrated on travel, what he called his ultimate frame of reference, and was written in both English and Scots. It was often both published and read before his prose and was oriented to the travels he loved to write about and perfected the skill of writing fiction. Allan Massie wrote of Stevenson as \"a great poet and not a great novelist.\" This is echoed by many critics of RLS and those in Stevenson's works, which is still in dispute at the time and who had written on.
