Born in Lima, Peru, Gonzalo Fonseca was the eldest of four siblings. Both his maternal grandfather and his father were painters. He was born into a family that was culturally very active but not particularly wealthy. Growing up, the Fonseca home contained what could be considered a small museum with paintings by Francisco Goya, Diego Rivera, and Rufino Tamayo among others. The household included many musicians. As a teenager, he apprenticed with Manuel Bartoloni. His family, however, recognized the promise of his youth and sent him to Paris to study at the Ateliers d'art sacr\u00e9 in St. Germain des Pr\u00e9s. There, although much of his early work was abstract, much was strongly influenced by the teachings of the time. As a result of these influences, we find his sculpture Le Chien.

At some point in the early 1880s he developed serious respiratory problems that would cause his eventual death in 1894. There is some debate on whether it was tuberculosis, sarcoidosis or lung cancer, but he certainly believed he had tuberculosis. He spent the remaining eleven years of his life on his Samoan estate Vailima, working from South Seas.

After this act he was exiled by Claudius to Campania, until he was recalled on an embassy to Judea in 44. Claudius died soon after in 47.
