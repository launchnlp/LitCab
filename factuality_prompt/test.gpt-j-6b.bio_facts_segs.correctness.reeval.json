{"bio": "Republic of Ireland (also known as \"\u00c9ire\", \"Ireland\", \"Eire\" and \"\u00c9ire\") is a sovereign state in Ireland. It is usually described as a country \u2013 although its status as a state with internal sovereignty is disputed by Ireland's eastern neighbor, the United Kingdom, which administers it as one of its four constituent countries. According to the 2010 CIA World Factbook, the population of Ireland is 4.8 million[7] while the most recent Eurostat estimates put the population in 2018 at 4.8 million inhabitants or 5.4 million including second generation Irish people. It has a territory of about 5,000 km2 (1,969 sq mi)[8] of which about 4,000 km2 (1,531 sq mi)[8] is land and the remainder water. The island of Ireland was formerly divided into six counties, which in turn were divided into baronies, and later into civil parishes. The modern constitution and the system of government dates from the establishment of the Irish Free State as a dominion of the British Empire in 1922, when 25 of the 32 counties were transferred from the United Kingdom to the state. Irish is an Indo-European language belonging to the North Celtic branch. Ireland is geographically divided into four provinces (counties): Leinster, Munster, Connacht, and Ulster. Irish, Ulster-Scots and Scots are the first languages of large groups of the island's population. The culture of the island has long been bound to the British Isles. It developed from the Gaelic peoples of Ireland, Wales and Scotland, adopting many of their Gaelic traditions, including Christianity, poetry and storytelling. The language influenced the development of English as it is currently spoken worldwide, and is traditionally considered to have had such an influence on Anglo-Saxon, Celtic, Norwegian, Icelandic, Faroese and other languages, as well as many languages of the United States.
