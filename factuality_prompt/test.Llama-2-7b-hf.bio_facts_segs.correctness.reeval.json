{"bio": "Robert Browning (7 May 1812 \u2013 12 December 1889) was an English poet and playwright whose mastery of the dramatic monologue made him one of the foremost Victorian poets. His poems are known for their irony, characterization, dark humor, social commentary, historical settings, and challenging vocabulary and syntax. Early in his life, Browning suffered from a nervous disorder which caused him to lose his hearing. The loss of his hearing did not, however, affect his writing. Browning wrote his most famous dramatic monologues in the 1840s.

With fellow member Paul McCartney, he formed one of the most celebrated songwriting partnerships of the 20th century. Born and raised in Liverpool, Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager; his first band, the Quarrymen, evolved into the Beatles in 1960. When the group disbanded in 1970, Lennon pursued a solo career that produced the albums John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band and Imagine, and songs such as \"Give Peace a Chance\" and \"Imagine\". After his marriage to Yoko Ono in 1969, he changed his name to John Ono Lennon. Lennon disengaged himself from the music business in 1975 to raise his infant son Sean, but re-emerged with Ono in 1980 with the new album Double Fantasy.
