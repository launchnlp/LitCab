{"bio": "Philip V of Spain (Spanish: Felipe V), known as Philip the Angry (Spanish: Felipe el Vivo), was King of Spain from 1 November 1700 to 9 July 1724, when he abdicated. The first person born outside of the Spanish Royal Family to become king, Philip was born in Paris to King Louis XIV of France and his new mistress, the Spanish Princess Maria Teresa. Due to his birth, he was named Duke of Anjou before he was called Philip by his family, the second son of King Louis XIV and his second wife, Maria Theresa of Spain. He was known in Spain as Philip V from 1700 onwards, although he did use his birth title Duc d'Anjou throughout his reign. Philip inherited the claim to the Spanish throne from his uncle, the infanta, Philip III of Spain, when he died childless in 1665. When his father Louis XIV of France began to consider his heir, Louis, Duke of Burgundy, in 1682, the prospect of the French invasion to put Louis \"on the Spanish throne\" caused a major international crisis in which England and the United Provinces fought on the anti-French side while the Empire, Savoy, and France itself opposed them. In 1684, Louis made overtures toward peace that were exploited by the English to force Louis XIV to promise to renounce any thought of putting his grandson in Spain. In 1688, a grandson of Charles II, Felipe of Anjou, was killed at sea during the fleet's return from an unsuccessful expedition to revive the Latin Empire in Constantinople.

{"bio": "Prison Break is an American television serial drama created by Paul Scheuring for FOX that was broadcast in the United States from 2005 to 2009. The series revolves around two brothers, Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell) and Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller), who escape prison and form a daring plan to break their wrongful imprisonment by using Michael's specialist knowledge to create a seemingly-impossible plan on how to do so. Meanwhile, Lincoln's brother A.D. Biller (Mark Feuerstein) is sent to foil the plan by breaking into the prison, while the rest of the series is dedicated to the two brothers and their efforts to remain free while on the run from both those who sent them to prison and also those sent to bring them back. Each season contains a cliffhanger that often leaves the audience with a big question, which drives the next season and the following episodes in that season. The series is produced by Adelstein/Parouse Entertainment, DreamWorks, 20th Century Fox Television and Wonderland Sound and Vision. The pilot episode premiered in the United States on October 9, 2005. Fox broadcast the first three seasons of the show on Tuesday nights. Midway through the third season, the schedule was changed to a Thursday night slot. Due to the show's performance in the ratings, Fox decided, after four seasons, to cancel Prison Break. However, on April 5, 2008, Fox Entertainment president Kevin Reilly announced via Twitter that Prison Break has been revived due to popular demand. During the revival season, it aired from April 1, to August 21, 2009. A fourth season consisting of fourteen episodes was later announced, though FOX announced later that it was the final season. Seasons one to three, as well as the final fourteenth season, became available on Netflix in March and April 2018. Prison Break is popular in Eastern Europe, where it airs on Fox Crime, and it will be aired on AXN, an English language channel of Astro in Malaysia.\n", "facts": ["1.

{"bio": "Look at My Dab is a 1999 dance song written, produced and performed by M.I.A. It was released as the third North American single from the British rapper's debut studio album, Arular. The track features additional production and backing vocals from Blaqstarr. DJs are encouraged to play a dubstep sample of the bassline when M.I.A.'s vocals come in. The song also borrows from the classic Parliament song \"P Funk (Wants to Get Funked Up),\" which is performed by Bootsy Collins. The song is the final track on the original track listing of Arular. The album version has a slightly different instrumental, which was recorded as a \"stereo version\" for inclusion on the album's second edition.

There is little evidence that prehistoric peoples inhabited the eastern area that became the United States; instead, this land served in part as a pathway for people migrating from Asia. It was explored by British and French explorers from 1583. The English and the French struggled for control of different parts of the region in the 17th century, including the coastal region. English settlement in the region increased, with the first permanent English settlement (Plymouth, Massachusetts) and subsequent colonies being founded in 1620. At the time, the land was controlled in large parts by European monarchies, notably the French and the Spanish; the French and Indian War marked the first major European conflict for control of the territory later to be known at the United States and ultimately the British victory over France resulted in the region becoming part of the British Empire. The American Revolution was a turning point for the colonies in the war for independence from Britain, resulting in the formation of the United States. The United States took over from the British and Spanish control of many territories, notably Louisiana in 1803. The Oregon territory was eventually purchased from Great Britain and Russia. Slaves were brought to America in the early years of colonisation, particularly in the south, and were used heavily in some states. During the 1800s, the states of the Americas grew in population and power, leading to a series of conflicts (including the American Civil War) before unity was eventually established by the 1860s. The two world wars involved large amounts of population. As a superpower in the second half of the 20th century, the United States was significantly involved in the Cold War with the Soviet Union.

The programme depicts the adventures of a mysterious, time-travelling humanoid alien known as the Doctor. He explores the universe in his TARDIS, often travelling with companions whose lives he has saved. Since the debut of the show in 1963, the character has been played by twelve actors, plus two musicians \u2013 one for the Doctor's theme song and one for his song of regeneration. The show holds the Guinness world record for the longest-running sci-fi series in production and as of February 2016 it is in its 53rd series. The show has been recognised for its imaginative stories, creative low-budget design, and pioneering use of electronic music and special effects, some of which remain unique for their use during the series' original run, others for their use in British television. Since the show's inception, more than 500 actors have appeared in Doctor Who, nearly 2,000 different costumes have been used and 22 different directors of photography and more than 1,000 members of the production team have worked on the show. In recognition of the show's longevity, the Guinness Book of World Records named it the \"longest-running science fiction television series in the world\" in 1990.

{"bio": "Cosmetics, also called make-up or makeup, are care substances used to enhance the appearance or odor of the human body. Many cosmetics are designed for use on the face and hair. They are generally mixtures of chemical compounds, some being derived from natural sources (such as coconut oil), and some being synthetics.

{"bio": "Vedanta literally means \"the end of the Vedas,\" and refers to the philosophical conclusion or pinnacle of the knowledge taught by the Vedas, the ancient religious texts of Hinduism. Hindu philosophers disagreed on who was the original teacher of the Upanishads, but most consider the ancient Indian sage \u015avetaketu to be the first to teach them. The Upanishads are found in Hinduism's scripture, the Prasthanatrayi.

{"bio": "Performance (film) is a 1970 British film directed by Nicolas Roeg and starring James Fox and Mick Jagger. The screenplay, written by Donald Cammell and written with Nicholas Roeg, was semi-autobiographical regarding actor James Fox's affair with Anita Pallenberg, who was also Jagger's companion at the time. The film is noteworthy for its use of experimental narrative techniques, a hallucinatory soundtrack by Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards, and its bold use of the sex and taboo topics of homosexuality and sexual fetishes. Performance was highly controversial in both Europe and the United States. It was banned in Ireland, and the American distributor was arrested under obscenity charges, which were eventually dropped.
