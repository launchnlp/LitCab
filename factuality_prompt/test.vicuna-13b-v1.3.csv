The article goes on to suggest that the NHL's current bargaining position is already weaker due to the fact that the NHL's revenue has grown at a slower rate than the NBA and MLB in recent years. What are your thoughts? Do you think Trump's comments about a potential strike could impact the NHL's bargaining position in CBA negotiations? Or do you think the NHL's current bargaining position is weak due to other factors? [/quote] #KUWTK: The Kardashian Family Gets Blasted By Trolls Over Their “Fake” and “B"

However, he always maintained that he abdicated because he could not rule without the support of the British people, and his marriage was just one of the reasons. #Banksters #Corruption #CrimeNetwork #EconomicCrisis

USER: ",Charles I of England,"Charles I of England, Scotland and Ireland was born on 19 November 1600. He ruled the three kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland from 27 March 1625 until his execution in 1649. Charles was the second son of James I, but he became heir apparent following the death of his older brother, Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, in 1612. An advocate of the divine right of kings, Charles believed that he was appointed by God and was therefore not subject to earthly authority. This led to a series of clashes with the English Parliament, which sought to limit the king's power and impose its own agenda. The conflict between Charles and Parliament eventually led to the English Civil War (1642–1651), in which Charles was defeated and later executed. Charles' reign remains a subject of historical debate and his legacy continues to shape British political and constitutional development. #206: Sweethearts

It is a political process that can be initiated by the lower legislative body or by a vote of no confidence in the upper chamber. The grounds for impeachment can vary depending on the country and the constitutional framework, but some common charges include bribery, corruption, treason, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. The impeachment process typically involves a formal investigation and a hearing in which evidence is presented and arguments are made for or against the charges. If a successful vote is made to impeach, the individual is suspended from office and is then put on trial in a court of law to determine whether the charges against them are proven. If the individual is found guilty, they may be removed from office and face other penalties such as disqualification from holding public office in the future. #WPLongform, Food for Thought, India, Inspirations, Photo Essay, Post A Day 2013, This is Life, tvaraj

USER: ",Caracazo,"Caracazo (1989) refers to a widespread wave of protests and riots that took place in Venezuela in 1989 resulting in a death toll estimated between 300 to 5,000, the majority of whom were poor people attacked by security forces and right-wing groups. The disturbances were caused by an economic crisis and a rise in the cost of living, with inflation rising to over 100% by the end of 1988. The protests were fueled by resentment of the government's austerity measures and corruption. The government declared a state of emergency, and called in the military and police to suppress the protests. This caused an increase in violence as armed forces and right-wing groups started attacking the protesters and even ordinary citizens. The government eventually declared a general amnesty for the events of the Caracazo. The events of the Caracazo are often seen as a warning of the deeper economic and social problems that were to come with the Bolivarian Revolution two decades later. #KickstarterKarma: Making A Difference

Archimedes is said to have been killed during the Second Punic War in the midst of defending his native Syracuse against Romans, though the details of his death are not known with certainty.

USER: ",Glacier,"Glacier, or glaciers, are large, persistent bodies of ice that move slowly down a slope or valley, with a typical thickness of at least 40 meters and a length of more than 0.1 kilometers. They are formed from the accumulation of snow and ice and are categorized into two types; alpine glaciers that are found in mountainous regions and continental glaciers which are found in the polar regions of the Earth. Glaciers shape the landscape by eroding rock and soil and depositing it as sediment, creating unique landforms such as moraines, U-shaped valleys, and cirques. They also influence climate by regulating the balance between the accumulation and ablation of snow and ice and contribute to the formation of rivers and lakes. Glaciers have been and are still used as natural resources for different purposes such as water supply, transportation, recreation, and power generation. #8426083, By ChestnutTree TripAdvisor reviews of The Coach and Horses
