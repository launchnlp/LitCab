USER: ",Social justice,"Social justice is the proper functioning of the social institutions within a society that allow for everyone to have a fair share in that society and to maintain a fair degree of social coherence. A proper functioning of social institutions is that which ensures that opportunities for developing individuals, families, groups, and communities are readily available without barriers such as discrimination and/or poverty. The social justice framework involves the ""distribution of resources (including income) produced by a society"" and attempts to remedy inequalities that exist in such distributions.[1][2][3] Social justice may be sought ""through a government-sponsored welfare state, or through private charitable efforts by individuals and organizations, or a combination of the two.""[4] The philosopher John Rawls defines social justice as the “fair value” of the natural social assets that an individual holds and the social benefits which they realize. He defines the social assets, and the resulting social benefits, as the equal rights and liberties of citizens and the powers and responsibilities which they enjoy. For Rawls, social benefits are those societal benefits, such as health and longevity, which are produced by “social cooperation”, which he says may “raise the value of one’s position relative to everyone else.”[5][6] To ensure that social benefits are distributed fairly in society, Rawls suggests principles to inform the workings of “social institutions”,[7] which he defines as social organizations established by human beings to regulate collective action; including: “families, groups and communities, as well as national institutions and international institutions”. He argues that these principles form the basis of “social justice” and that when applied to the working of social institutions they will deliver social benefits to the members of society in proportion to their social assets.

I am always interested when some of my students or clients ask me about the origins of the name of a place, and what I usually tell them is that the origins of many names still survive in the English language, albeit in many cases undergoing an alteration in spelling. Most such alterations, though they may seem quirky, are in fact very easy to predict – they are usually a result of the normal rules of the pronunciation and spelling of English.

USER: ",Plato,"Plato was an Athenian philosopher during the Classical period in Ancient Greece, founder of the Platonist school of thought, writer of philosophical works and teacher of Aristotle, founder of the Peripatetic school. Plato's informal conversations (Socratic dialogues) recorded in writing by his student, Plato, had significant influence on Western philosophy. Plato (428/427 – 347/348 B.C.) is considered by many as the greatest philosopher of all time and the most influential figure in philosophy of the Western world (he coined the term 'philosophy' as we know it today). Through his teacher Socrates, Plato examined the essence of knowledge, or the 'good', and the implications of this quest. Plato wrote that the fundamental problem in philosophy is to determine the 'true' nature of reality, the true form of 'the good' and 'the beautiful', and it was in attempting to do this that he became one of the first philosophers to distinguish between appearance and reality. He also coined many terms known today, including 'eidos' and 'amorphos'.

USER: ",Republic of Ireland,"Republic of Ireland, also known as Eire and Ireland, is a parliamentary republic in North-Western Europe occupying five-sixths of the island of Ireland. The Republic of Ireland is a member of the European Union and is a developed country with an average GDP per capita of € 29,617. The roots of Irish nationalism, republicanism, and independence lie in the 19th century Irish Rebellion of 1798, which was the beginning of a campaign for independence. From 1801 until the early 20th century, large portions of Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, which led to a growing Irish independence movement. After over a century of campaigning for various kinds of Home Rule within Ireland, Irish republicans seized upon the Easter Uprising in Dublin in 1916 to seize political and military control of 26 of Ireland's 32 counties and to proclaim the Irish Republic. This came to an end when it was suppressed by British forces by the end of the month. During 1918-21, British forces intervened on numerous occasions in an attempt to crush the Republic of Ireland, but they failed to achieve that goal. In 1921-22, the Anglo-Irish Treaty established the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland in place of the United Kingdom's jurisdiction in most of Ireland.

USER: ",George Best,"George Best (22 May 1946 – 25 November 2005) was a Northern Irish professional footballer who played as a winger for Manchester United and the Northern Ireland national team. In 1968, he won the European Footballer of the Year Award and was the inaugural winner of the Ballon d'Or. Although he studied for a period at the London College of Fashion, Best pursued his football career full-time and in doing so turned his back on his education, but at one point he was noted as the highest-paid footballer in the world. A transfer to the Italian team Juventus in 1976 meant he was unable to secure a work permit to play for another English club until 1981 when he joined the second-tier Queen's Park Rangers. He continued to be selected for the Northern Ireland team, though their manager Tommy Docherty and their Football Association considered him to have lost interest. In 1983, after two months in the United States at the New York Cosmos, he joined the second-tier Football League team, the California Surf. His career ended with brief stints at the English Football League teams Cambridge United.

USER: ","Charles, Prince of Wales","Charles the Great (Latin: Carolus; German: Karl, literally ""man""), also known as Charlemagne (French: Charlemagne), numbered Charles I, was King of the Franks from 768 to his death in 814 and Emperor of the Romans (Imperator Romanorum) from 800 to his death in 814. During his reign, he expanded the Frankish kingdom into an empire that incorporated much of Western and Central Europe. He was the first recognised emperor to rule from western Europe since the fall of the Western Roman Empire three centuries earlier. The expanded Frankish state which Charlemagne founded became known in the English-speaking world as the Holy Roman Empire (though the empire's polity and legal order were, at least in theory, generally based upon Roman law and the traditions of the Catholic Church) and in the French-speaking world as the Carolingian Empire.

USER: ",Impeachment,"Impeachment is the process by which a legislature formally levels charges against a high official of government. Impeachment does not automatically mean removal from office; it is rather a formal statement of charges, akin to an indictment in criminal law, and is thus only the first step towards removal. Once an individual is impeached, he or she must then face the possibility of conviction via legislative vote. The word impeach comes from the Latin impedicare, which means literally to ""obstruct"" as in impede the progress of an individual, but also ""make a charge of serious misconduct against an individual"". It is usually used when the allegations concern the commission of a crime for which the individual may be tried by a court. The term is also used to describe the act of formally bringing accusations against someone, particularly in the criminal sense. Used more narrowly, ""impeachment"" properly refers to the actual trial held by the Senate on behalf of the House of Representatives, whether or not the final result is approval or disapproval of the charges and subsequent removal from office.

USER: ",Elvis Presley,"Elvis Presley (; January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977) was an American singer, actor and songwriter. One of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as ""the King of Rock and Roll"", or simply, ""the King"". Born in Tupelo, Mississippi, Presley and his family moved to Memphis, Tennessee, when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954 when he started to work with Sam Phillips, the owner of Sun Records. Accompanied by guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, Presley was an early popularizer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who was to manage the singer for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, ""Heartbreak Hotel"", released in January 1956, was a number-one hit in the US. He became the leading figure of rock and roll after a series of network television appearances and chart-topping records. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines that coincided with the dawn of the Civil Rights Movement, made him enormously popular—and controversial. In November 1956, he made his film debut in Love Me Tender.

USER: ",Venus,"Venus is the second-closest planet to the Sun, orbiting it every 224.7 days. It has an eccentric orbit and rotates slowly, progressing from west to east. It has been called ""Earth's sister planet"" but was historically considered a malefic planet. It was probably once a comet that entered the inner Solar System. It is the most similar of all the Earth's neighbors, being like Earth in mass, size, and bulk composition. However, its surface is more geologically active than Earth's and it lacks a magnetic field and an asteroid belt. Its surface is in active competition with Earth, with Earth being roughly 4.5 billion years old and Venus being roughly 4.9 billion years old. It is shrouded by an opaque layer of highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from being seen from space, except in rare instances when the planetary albedo provides sufficient reflection to reveal the planet's cloud-tops. It may have had water oceans in the past, but these may have dried up over the course of Venus's history.

Published by the Hearst Corporation, Cosmopolitan has 64 international editions, is printed in 35 languages, and is distributed in more than 100 countries. Cosmopolitan began as a family magazine, launched on March 16, 1886 by scholar John Jay Chapman, literary editor Mary Harmon, political advice columnist Hamilton Owens. The first issue was sold at newsstands for one cent. By 1889, when it was purchased by Schlicht & Field, it was the most successful women's magazine. By 1892, circulation had increased to 25,000, allowing the magazine to turn a profit. That same year, William Randolph Hearst began distribution of the magazine through the Cosmopolitan Book Corporation (1892–1905). By 1894, circulation increased to 75,000. At the time, it was commonly understood that printing and circulation costs were the greatest costs for any publisher, making advertising important for revenue. To increase advertising revenue, in 1897 Hearst introduced sections or ""chapters"" of special editorial content which could be sponsored by advertisers. These sponsored sections could be thicker than other portions of the magazine and they allowed the magazine to have a greater number of advertising pages. That same year, Hearst sold the magazine to a New York firm to concentrate on the New York Journal. In 1911, the magazine was acquired by Schlicht & Field as a result of the bankruptcy of the Cosmopolitan Book Corporation. In 1915, it was bought by William Randolph Hearst and the Hearst Corporation. The early 1900s saw the rise of the modern women's magazine in the United States.

The agreement was brokered by the G6 Foreign ministers, i.e. the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany, with the United States, the European Union and Russia playing leading roles. The Dayton Accords put and end to the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina and gave birth to a statelet known as the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The agreement created a complex system of governance for former Yugoslavia's provinces, created joint security forces (primarily consisting of the Army of RS and JNA), established rules for the division of territory to the two sides, and the power to be shared among the three major ethnic groups. However, the military aspects of the agreement did not last long, as a general conflict between former members of the Army of Yugoslav Federation and Army of the Republic of Serbia continued into the creation of the Army of the Bosnian Federation (Vojska Federacije Bosne i Hercegovine).

Rock music has also drawn strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk music, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical traditions, which have collectively been termed rock music. Although rock has had its roots in the United States at first, it was adopted and blended into local cultures across the globe, and in the 1970s, rock became infused with heavy metal and punk.

USER: ",Agatha Christie,"Agatha Christie was a British crime writer of novels, short stories, and plays published under her name. She also wrote romances as Mary Westmacott, but she is best remembered for her 80 detective novels. She is considered one of the greatest writers of mysteries. Her works have sold over a billion copies—a figure only surpassed by the Bible and the works of William Shakespeare. Her estate claims that three billion copies have been sold. According to the Guinness World Records, Christie's works come third in the list of best-selling books, behind only Shakespeare and the Bible. She is the only British crime writer to have been given officer rank in the French military: in 1919 she was made a Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres for her contribution to the arts of France. She has been called the ""Queen of Crime"", a title bestowed by the Academy of Crime as a lifetime achievement award for someone who has contributed to the field of crime literature. Her first novel, the Belgian expatriate tale The Mysterious Affair at Styles, was published in 1920. Two years later, The Blue Book magazine published a list of the best 100 books since 1920, with The Murder of Roger Ackroyd placed at no. 39 and And Then There Were None at no. 77 on the list, marking the enduring appeal of Agatha Christie's novels. She is credited with making detective and crime stories accessible to a wide audience, particularly with books such as The Mysterious Affair at Styles. She was successful because, unlike Edgar Allan Poe, she did not create stories about evil geniuses – instead she used ""regular"" people to solve the crimes. Christie's works are known for baffling mysteries, high-functioning detectives, complex plots, twist endings, and intriguing characters. According to literary historian G. K. Hall, her works are often at their best when she is employing all of these elements to play off against one another. She also used these narrative devices to subvert the genre's standards and expectations. She also uses the narrative device of allowing the first-person narrator, who is one of the main suspects, to"

USER: ",Vietnam War,"Vietnam War (Chuẩn quốc dân chреng Riềng Biệt Nam; or 戰爭越南 Cheng zheng Yuè Nán), also known as the Second Indochina War and the Vietnam Conflict, was a cold war-era military conflict that occurred in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia from 1 November 1955 to the fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975. This war followed the First Indochina War (1946–54) and was fought between North Vietnam—supported by the Soviet Union, China, and other communist allies—and the government of South Vietnam—supported by the United States, Philippines, Australia, Thailand and other anti-communist allies. The war is considered a Cold War-eraproxy war by some US perspectives, and some of the larger operations in it were, at times, carried out concurrently with the Laotian Civil War and the Cambodian Civil War; all three were largely fought by proxy forces in the region, with the US and Soviet Union supplying their respective proxies with weapons, training and intelligence support. Most of the fighting during the Vietnam War occurred in South Vietnam, but fighting also occurred in the north, Laos, and Cambodia, and from 1961–1970, small-scale battles occurred in Vietnam's Central Highlands. The primary military entities were the North Vietnamese Army and the People's Army of Vietnamfor the Communist side, and the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) and, beginning in 1965, the Republic of Korea Armed Forces (KorUS) and the US Armed Forces for the South Vietnamese side. The Viet Cong (also known as the National Liberation Front, or NLF), a South Vietnamese communist common front aided by the North, also participated in the war.

In his mid-teenage years, after discovering acting in a playwriting class in high school, he got a scholarship to study acting at the American Music and Dramatic Academy (AMDA) in Los Angeles, which is where he received most of his training at the time.

During that time, he worked as a waiter, delivered junk mail, and washed cars to support himself. Anthony’s love of acting drove him to fight for his dream and despite many obstacles and poverty, it’s his love of the craft and his passion for teaching that’s given him the opportunity to become one of the most in-demand coaches in Hollywood.
