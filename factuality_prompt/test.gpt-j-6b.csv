A year later, Adebayor moved to the Spanish league with Athletic Bilbao. This was followed by spells with Monaco and the Togolese national team. In August 2007, Adebayor returned to the English Premier League, linking up at Tottenham Hotspur with Keane again. In his early career, Adebayor enjoyed great success as his excellent technique, speed and physical conditioning made him an automatic penalty taker. In his later years, however, Adebayor's time at the top level has been marred by recurring injuries, a lack of form and a lack of club interest in signing him. ""The Destroyer"" has scored over fifty goals in his professional career, most notably two vital headers against England in the 2002 World Cup.

However, many dyes tend to have short range excitation and emission spectra (less than about 400 nm and less than about 500 nm, respectively) and often only fluoresce over a portion of the absorption portion of the spectrum. Futher still, some dyes fluoresce in solution but only when bound to a macromolecular target, such as protein, lipid, or nucleic acid. For such applications it is desired to have a dye which fluoresces well in solution and also when bound to a macromolecular target as a substitute for the dye which has short range excitation and emission spectra, or which has low fluorescence in solution. Futher, as these biological applications and assays become more important, it becomes necessary to target a biological molecule which is in a native environment, rather than in a free solution. Still further, it becomes desirable to target a dye which specifically binds to a native biological macromolecule, such as a protein.

It stars Mark Wahlberg, Nicola Peltz, Stanley Tucci, John Turturro, Helen Mirren, Stanley Tucci, Ken Jeong, Tyrese Gibson, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Kelsey Grammer, and Burt Reynolds. It also depicts many other actors, and introduces for the first time the Dinobots, characters from the previous film, Revenge of the Fallen (2009). The film is produced by Michael Bay, his production company BayFilm and Paramount Pictures, and distributed by Paramount Pictures. It opened to positive reviews, with praise for the visual effects, and a strong opening box office performance; it was a box office success, grossing over $1 billion worldwide on a $225 million budget. Although some critics and viewers were concerned at its violence and profane language, others saw it as a return to the ""fun"" style of the original film series and an example of a ""good time"" that, unlike previous sequels, did not focus more on action than the story itself. This statement was echoed by critics, who stated that Transformers: Age of Extinction was the first animated film to successfully capture the pure escapist thrill of the early 1980s.

Founding members Chris Cornell and Kim Fowley first recorded on a four-track machine and released a seven-inch 45 RPM record on their own, Singles, on Sub Pop Records.

USER: ",Republic of Ireland,"Republic of Ireland (also known as ""Éire"", ""Ireland"", ""Eire"" and ""Éire"") is a sovereign state in Ireland. It is usually described as a country – although its status as a state with internal sovereignty is disputed by Ireland's eastern neighbor, the United Kingdom, which administers it as one of its four constituent countries. According to the 2010 CIA World Factbook, the population of Ireland is 4.8 million[7] while the most recent Eurostat estimates put the population in 2018 at 4.8 million inhabitants or 5.4 million including second generation Irish people. It has a territory of about 5,000 km2 (1,969 sq mi)[8] of which about 4,000 km2 (1,531 sq mi)[8] is land and the remainder water. The island of Ireland was formerly divided into six counties, which in turn were divided into baronies, and later into civil parishes. The modern constitution and the system of government dates from the establishment of the Irish Free State as a dominion of the British Empire in 1922, when 25 of the 32 counties were transferred from the United Kingdom to the state. Irish is an Indo-European language belonging to the North Celtic branch. Ireland is geographically divided into four provinces (counties): Leinster, Munster, Connacht, and Ulster. Irish, Ulster-Scots and Scots are the first languages of large groups of the island's population. The culture of the island has long been bound to the British Isles. It developed from the Gaelic peoples of Ireland, Wales and Scotland, adopting many of their Gaelic traditions, including Christianity, poetry and storytelling. The language influenced the development of English as it is currently spoken worldwide, and is traditionally considered to have had such an influence on Anglo-Saxon, Celtic, Norwegian, Icelandic, Faroese and other languages, as well as many languages of the United States. Irish cuisine includes dishes such as boxty and cabbage and meat coddle, and some traditional dishes are still popular today, such as champ and cabbage, boxty, and Irish stew.

It includes both the Kandahar and Panjshir valleys and the high Tian Shan range. The country can also be referred to as the ""Garland of the Orient"" because of its varied topography.

It is also home to a long, natural border with Pakistan, which is more rugged. The name Afghanistan is derived from the historical region of Afro-Iran, a cultural and linguistic region in Southern Iran, today's southeast Iran. Its location makes it the second-largest country in Central Asia (after Kazakhstan), although it borders some of the world's largest countries, including China, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.

The two members, especially Page and Jones, have been considered the most prominent members of what is now called the ""classic era"" of progressive rock. Their sound is characterised by polyrhythmic and densely layered instrumental textures, a focus on dynamic shifting between heavy rhythms and extended sonic excursions that employ improvisation techniques. Led Zeppelin changed the sound of popular music and has been referred to as an influence by other artists such as The Beatles, The Who, and Pink Floyd.

USER: ","Charles, Prince of Wales","Charles (14th century or later), Duke of Burgundy, known as the Bold, was a renowned Burgundian nobleman. As the duke's life is unclear due to conflicting accounts, historians and literary scholars have tried to reconstruct what he was probably like and his personality. Scholars and historians generally depict him as a good-looking, powerful, warlike, and ambitious man. He lived his life in the shadow of his father, whose death had left him ruler over only a small portion of the Duchy of Burgundy – and he used those resources to become the lord of much of the County of Artois. Although the only surviving records refer to him as duke of the whole region, historians are also unsure whether the title actually existed during his time, since it was not recorded in contemporary charters. Most historians agree that there cannot have been more than one duke of the whole Duchy of Burgundy at the time and that they therefore had to have been the same man – in such a case, the ""earliest known"" would make the correct one of the two.

USER: ",Modern liberalism in the United States,"Modern liberalism in the United States is a philosophy commonly associated with the economic and industrialist philosophy of a capitalist society that emphasizes the moral obligation of state and corporate officials to the general population. Its first identifiable manifestation was the New Deal reforms of the 1930s, which included various programs to combat poverty, improve healthcare, build public infrastructure, and regulate businesses. After World War II, as the United States faced issues with the loss of economic infrastructure and the growth of poverty among its population, modern liberalism grew in prominence and influence. The most visible modern liberals were the New Deal Democrats led by Harry S. Truman, who became the 36th President of the United States and Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr., who became United States Senator for New York in 1951 until his death in 1972; they were followed by Democrats such as Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Nelson A. Rockefeller. Beginning in the 1960s, a new group of progressive Democrats emerged, which included other politicians such as George McGovern, Edward M. Kennedy, and Eugene McCarthy, often termed the ""New Consensus"", although the majority of them shared many of the goals of the New Deal. However, after the Watergate Scandal and other political infighting and scandals which dominated the 1970s, the modern liberalism movement became severely weakened, although it survived and remained influential into the 1980s.

USER: ",Paris (mythology),"Paris (mythology) was a city from classical antiquity (present-day Greece) which lies on the opposite side of the Ionian Sea from Rome (in present-day Italy). It is the most southerly and largest city of ancient Greece, founded in 335 BC by the Greek statesman and general Alexander the Great and named after him, who had been named the son of the Greek sun god Helios. In 467 BC, it was captured by the Carthaginian general Pyrrhus of Epirus during the Pyrrhic War, but Pyrrhus was defeated there in 275 BC. The city was taken by the Romans in 146 BC as part of their conquest of Greece, and a Roman colony was later established there. Ancient Greek legend ascribes many virtues to Paris, the most famous of which is that he brought the gods down to earth to be closer to mortals. The story is probably part of the literary tradition established by Plato's Symposium.

USER: ",Major League Soccer,"Major League Soccer (MLS), sometimes called ""World soccer"" to distinguish it from the United States Soccer Federation, is a professional soccer league in the United States and Canada, sanctioned by and operated under the auspices of the U.S. Soccer Federation, an organization within the United States Soccer Federation. It is the second most popular club sport in the United States, after the National Football League. It is among the world's top soccer leagues. Soccer in North America dates back to the late 1880s, when the United States Soccer Football Association was founded, and Canada entered the federation in June 1892. The first soccer World Cup was held in conjunction with the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri and featured both the United States and Canada. The MLS was formed in 1996 as an alternative to the existing North American Soccer League and United Soccer League competitions. Before the 1998-1999 season, the new league absorbed the existing USL; by the end of the season, the MLS had twenty-six teams, and had grown rapidly to four more by the end of its first season. Major League Soccer adopted its present name that season, as MLS Soccer was not consistent with the league's branding. The league has since had an official logo and a consistent brand, as well as several name changes. In 2001, a division of MLS based in the southern United States was renamed as a result of sponsorship deals with car manufacturers Hyundai (which sponsored the San Jose Earthquakes) and Dodge (which sponsored the New England Revolution).

USER: ",Iran,"Iran (;  ˈɪɑnə or ˈaʊənə; Persian: ايران‎ or əran) is the most extensive of several great ancient Iranian empires, located primarily along the southern shore of the Caspian Sea, with one of its capitals at Nineveh. After the fall of the Achaemenid Empire in 330 BC, the nation was split into competing kingdoms, with the Sasanian Empire being the last Iranian Achaemenid Empire or Persian Empire to rule until the late 8th century AD. During the Sasanian and early Islamic eras, Iran was variously conquered by a number of non-Iranian powers, including the Romans, Parthians, Kushans, Seleucids, Byzantine Romans, and Arabs, among others. The Islamic conquest of Iran was achieved by the Islamic prophet and one of the most important caliphs in Islam, Muhammad, who began to assemble the Muslims as a state in 634 and captured the Abbasid capital of Baghdad on August 29, 630. Most of the non-Muslim Persians of Iran were either killed or resettled in the Ottoman, Safavid, Afsharid and Zand dynasties of Iran from the 13th to 19th centuries, although a Persian-speaking elite class survived in Iran. This elite class later came to be known as the Qajar dynasty, the last dynasty to reign in Iran before the rise of the Pahlavis in the 19th century. Persians or Iranians (, Pūsistānī or Pūrsīstanī) are the largest ethnic group in Iran, comprising over 85% of the nation's population. Persian culture has been influential in the development of Iranian society, politics, and art and the spoken Persian language is the first language of approximately 85–90 million people, making it the third most widely spoken language in the world.

USER: ",Venus,"Venus is the second-brightest natural object in the Solar System, after our Sun. Like Earth, Venus is a terrestrial planet that orbits very close to the Sun, completing an orbit in about 225 days, as compared to 225.8 Earth years. Because of its proximity to the Sun, Venus is strongly heated and all but saturated with atmospheric gases. Venus is tidally locked to the Sun. So its day is very long, taking 118.7 Earth days to complete. Its night is very brief – 6 hours, as opposed to Earth's 24 hours – but the planet completes one rotation on its axis in a time considerably shorter than Earth's. Venus's surface temperature averages about 835 kelvin, making it the hottest planet in the Solar System, although the surface is heavily laden with sulphuric acid rain. The very rapid rotation of the planet results in a dense atmosphere about 50 km (100,000 ft) thick of super-heated gases held aloft by the Sun's gravitational attraction.

BC and home of an influential tyrant. According to Xenophon, Stagira controlled the surrounding region through ""the most powerful government of any in Greece"", and its king was the first of Greece to use silver currency when he minted coins for the population of Magnesia. His coinage was based on the image of a sphinx; the sphinx was the symbol of Athena, and the sphinx was regarded as her image, thus symbolising that the city was ruled by Athena. After Alexander the Great conquered the region, he renamed the city after himself, declaring it ""Alexandria"". After the Achaean League was formed by the cities of Achaea in 338 BC, the city was renamed Stagira for ""the first"".  Stagira has been listed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) on its World Heritage List, as Ancient Stagira and Ancient Messene.

USER: ","Mary Marvel, Otto Binder","Mary Marvel was a fictional heroine created in 1941 by the writer Max Elbaum. She has been called the first major American superheroine, and in her own right, as the first American ""supergirl."" She inspired many imitations. The character was created for the comic book Marvel Comics #15 (Aug. 1941), based on the earlier ""Tammie"" feature in the All-American Comics Magazine. She was part of an expanding lineup of costumed characters that the company was launching as part of its war effort during World War II. The character was created by Max Elbaum, who also created the Golden Age superhero the Atom. In the early 1940s, she was called Tammie, a name she used in her earlier comics. When comics characters were renamed for the United States' wartime propaganda, Mary's name was changed to Marvel. To avoid potential confusion with the similarly named character Marvel Comics first created in 1939, Max Elbaum chose to call his creation ""Marvel"" as he wanted the name to sound like a girl's name. After the company changed to Timely Comics, Marvel began to appear as part of its lineup of characters. Her costume of a short skirt and a belt with a buckle that became popular was later used by Captain Marvel comic books. At first, Mary Marvel appeared wearing the same costume as her Atom-era predecessor Tammie, but her costume was cut shorter, revealing more of her legs. After the war, the name ""Mary Marvel"" was revived for a second female superheroine.

USER: ",John Glenn,"John Glenn (November 18, 1921 – December 16, 2016) was an American aviator, astronaut, and politician. Considered to have been one of the greatest U.S. astronauts in history, he is the first American to orbit Earth and one of the last surviving members of NASA's original Mercury 7. He was also the oldest living astronaut and first American to orbit. A member of the U.S. Navy since 1942, he flew 77 combat missions as a Navy Grumman TBF Avenger in World War II and the Korean War and was a central figure in the astronaut corps during the Cold War space race. Glenn flew on three Mercury missions, two of those as Commander, and was assigned as Command Pilot for the maiden orbital spaceflight of the Mercury capsule Friendship 7. As the oldest alumnus of the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland (Class of 1942), and one of fewer than three hundred Americans qualified to be an astronaut, his many achievements made him a symbol of the space age. While flying his third space mission, in February 1962, Glenn became the second American in space. He went on to fly the Mercury space capsule on two extended spaceflights, the Mercury-Atlas 6 mission in orbital flight number 22 in April 1962 and in orbital flight number 24 seven months later. He was selected by NASA as the United States' first astronaut in the Mercury program, launched on his second mission as Commander of Friendship 7, and became the sixth American in space aboard Friendship 7. His first orbital spaceflight, Mercury orbital flight number 21, occurred ten days later, but lasted only one orbit. Glenn's third and final orbital spaceflight mission was designated orbital flight number 24 to allow the Mercury spacecraft to make multiple orbits, which required Glenn to be in the spacecraft for almost a full 24-hour period. The Soviet Union had recently announced an end to any manned spaceflight program, and Glenn was on NASA's highest priority mission. Glenn made the second-to-last Gemini program spaceflight in October 1966, a twenty-hour transcontinental pilot to-and-fro flight on the Gemini 10 mission. He was in the first group of astronauts to fly the newly developed NASA Gemini spacecraft, which became the mainstay space vehicle for NASA's human spaceflight program until the end of the Space Shuttle program in 2011. The most recent orbiter was named after him.

USER: ",Southport,"Southport, Cheshire, England, on the North Sea Coast, has long been a seaside resort, beginning in Roman times, and becoming a popular and fashionable place in the early 18th century. The famous poet, playwright, and satirist Ben Jonson published a poem about Southport in 1620. In 1807, it emerged for a period as a fashionable and exclusive place of residence, with notable residents including Lord Byron, William Wordsworth, and Lord Byron's half-brother. The first public health regulations were introduced in 1866, and by 1874 a tram service linked the resort to the town centre of Stockton. Southport expanded into a major resort during the 1970s and 1980s. Tourism now accounts for over half of the town's total income and visitor numbers. Its attractions include a traditional harbour, an 18th-century suspension footbridges over the sand dunes, an aquarium, and the Northgate Towers.

USER: ",Russia,"Russia (Russian: Россия Rossiya, tr. Rossiya; IPA: [ˈɾosiˈja]) is a country in northern Eurasia—bordering on both the Pacific Ocean and the Arctic Ocean as well as on European Russia as well as Belarus. A federal semi-presidential republic, Russia covers 11 time zones on the eastern half of the large continent of Eurasia, stretching west to west for about 9,780 kilometres (6,093 mi) along the Eurasian land mass, from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to the Pacific Ocean in the east, and from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea in the north. Although Russia is the largest nation by landmass, its total area is considerably smaller than that of Europe. The homeland of ethnic Russians, in its broader sense, is thus commonly understood to be the Russian FSU, which forms part of the Russian Federation, and also traditionally includes a large portion of Belarusian and Ukrainian territories. According to the International Monetary Fund, Russia is the world's largest country that is neither a developed country, a developing country, or a transition country.

USER: ",Taiwan,"Taiwan (/tʃɑˈnaʃ/; pinyin: táiwā) is an island country in East Asia. In a 2010 Gallup poll, Taiwan ranked seventh most-admired in the world. It is the only island within the Asia-Pacific region not entirely located within a continent or other major landmasses. The term ""East Asian"" is also sometimes applied to the area between mainland China to its west, Japan to its north, and South Korea to its east. The largest political divisions of Taiwan are determined by the Civil Code enacted in 1887. The ROC is divided into 25 administrative divisions and four cities, all of which have varying degrees of autonomy. Taiwan has been declared a ""Free Port Zone"" since the 1980s. Since the late 1990s, China has been aggressively promoting unification with Taiwan. Taiwan's status as a self-governed province of China is no longer the official position of the Beijing government. The position paper on Taiwan from the Foreign ministry of the People's Republic of China states that no one can make the decision about their country's status except the people of the country themselves, and the only solution at present is to maintain the territorial integrity and political status quo of China under the premise of ""One Country, Two Systems"".
