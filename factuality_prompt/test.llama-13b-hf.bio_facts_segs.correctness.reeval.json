{"bio": "Agatha Christie was a British crime writer of novels, short stories, and plays published under her name.

Her works have sold over a billion copies\u2014a figure only surpassed by the Bible and the works of William Shakespeare. Her estate claims that three billion copies have been sold. According to the Guinness World Records, Christie's works come third in the list of best-selling books, behind only Shakespeare and the Bible. She is the only British crime writer to have been given officer rank in the French military: in 1919 she was made a Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres for her contribution to the arts of France. She has been called the \"Queen of Crime\", a title bestowed by the Academy of Crime as a lifetime achievement award for someone who has contributed to the field of crime literature. Her first novel, the Belgian expatriate tale The Mysterious Affair at Styles, was published in 1920. Two years later, The Blue Book magazine published a list of the best 100 books since 1920, with The Murder of Roger Ackroyd placed at no. 39 and And Then There Were None at no. 77 on the list, marking the enduring appeal of Agatha Christie's novels. She is credited with making detective and crime stories accessible to a wide audience, particularly with books such as The Mysterious Affair at Styles. She was successful because, unlike Edgar Allan Poe, she did not create stories about evil geniuses \u2013 instead she used \"regular\" people to solve the crimes. Christie's works are known for baffling mysteries, high-functioning detectives, complex plots, twist endings, and intriguing characters. According to literary historian G. K. Hall, her works are often at their best when she is employing all of these elements to play off against one another.

{"bio": "Republic of Ireland, also known as Eire and Ireland, is a parliamentary republic in North-Western Europe occupying five-sixths of the island of Ireland. The Republic of Ireland is a member of the European Union and is a developed country with an average GDP per capita of \u20ac 29,617. The roots of Irish nationalism, republicanism, and independence lie in the 19th century Irish Rebellion of 1798, which was the beginning of a campaign for independence. From 1801 until the early 20th century, large portions of Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, which led to a growing Irish independence movement. After over a century of campaigning for various kinds of Home Rule within Ireland, Irish republicans seized upon the Easter Uprising in Dublin in 1916 to seize political and military control of 26 of Ireland's 32 counties and to proclaim the Irish Republic. This came to an end when it was suppressed by British forces by the end of the month. During 1918-21, British forces intervened on numerous occasions in an attempt to crush the Republic of Ireland, but they failed to achieve that goal. In 1921-22, the Anglo-Irish Treaty established the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland in place of the United Kingdom's jurisdiction in most of Ireland.\n", "facts": ["Republic of Ireland is a parliamentary republic in North-Western Europe", "Republic of Ireland occupies five-sixths of the island of Ireland", "Republic of Ireland is a member of the European Union", "Republic of Ireland is a developed country", "Republic of Ireland has an average GDP per capita of \u20ac 29,617", "Irish nationalism, republicanism, and independence stem from the 19th century Irish Rebellion of 1798", "The Irish Rebellion of 1798 marked the beginning of a campaign for independence", "Large portions of Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from 1801 until the early 20th century", "The United Kingdom's jurisdiction in most of Ireland led to a growing Irish independence movement", "Irish republicans seized political and military control of 26 of Ireland's 32 counties and proclaimed the Irish Republic during the Easter Uprising in Dublin in 1916", "The Easter Uprising was suppressed by British forces by the end of the month", "British forces attempted to crush the Republic of Ireland multiple times from 1918-21, but failed to achieve that goal", "The Anglo-Irish Treaty established the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland in place of the United Kingdom's jurisdiction in most of Ireland in 1921-22."], "segs": ["Republic of Ireland is a parliamentary republic in North-Western Europe.", "Republic of Ireland occupies five-sixths of the island of Ireland.", "The Republic of Ireland is a member of the European Union.", "The Republic of Ireland is a developed country with an average GDP per capita of \u20ac 29,617.", "The Republic of Ireland is a developed country with an average GDP per capita of \u20ac 29,617.", "\"The roots of Irish nationalism, republicanism, and independence lie in the 19th-century Irish Rebellion of 1798.\"", "The roots of Irish nationalism, republicanism, and independence lie in the 19th century Irish Rebellion of 1798, which was the beginning of a campaign for independence.", "From 1801 until the early 20th century.", "large portions of Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, which led to a growing Irish independence movement.", "After over a century of campaigning for various kinds of Home Rule within Ireland, Irish republicans seized upon the Easter Uprising in Dublin in 1916 to seize political and military control of 26 of Ireland's 32 counties and to proclaim the Irish Republic.", "This came to an end when it was suppressed by British forces by the end of the month.", "During 1918-21, British forces intervened on numerous occasions in an attempt to crush the Republic of Ireland, but they failed to achieve that goal.", "In 1921-22, the Anglo-Irish Treaty established the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland."], "facts_correctness": [true, true, true, true, false, false, false, true, true, true, true, true, true], "seg_scores": [0.3450416028499603, 0.914699375629425, 0.552645742893219, 0.24481748044490814, 0.24481748044490814, 0.35904642939567566, 0.3243437707424164, 0.5265228152275085, 0.39112740755081177, 0.3571779727935791, 0.2706487774848938, 0.26296404004096985, 0.4391576051712036], "LCS_segs": [" is a parliamentary republic in North-Western Europe", " five-sixths of the island of Ireland.", "The Republic of Ireland is a member of the European Union", "and is a developed country with an average GDP per capita of \u20ac 29,617.", "and is a developed country with an average GDP per capita of \u20ac 29,617.", "The roots of Irish nationalism, republicanism, and independence lie in the 19th", "The roots of Irish nationalism, republicanism, and independence lie in the 19th century Irish Rebellion of 1798, which was the beginning of a campaign for independence.", "From 1801 until the early 20th century", "large portions of Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, which led to a growing Irish independence movement.", "After over a century of campaigning for various kinds of Home Rule within Ireland, Irish republicans seized upon the Easter Uprising in Dublin in 1916 to seize political and military control of 26 of Ireland's 32 counties and to proclaim the Irish Republic.", "This came to an end when it was suppressed by British forces by the end of the month.", "During 1918-21, British forces intervened on numerous occasions in an attempt to crush the Republic of Ireland, but they failed to achieve that goal.", "In 1921-22, the Anglo-Irish Treaty established the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland"]}
