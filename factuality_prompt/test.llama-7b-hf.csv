Minaj's father came up with the idea and the track's title after watching a movie called Anaconda (1997), and the song's production, which features a distinct sample from Vicki Sue Robinson's 1979 song ""Turn the Beat Around"", was handled by will.i.am and Cirkut. Its verses are sung and rapped by Minaj alongside an interpolation from the TLC song, ""No Scrubs"". ""Anaconda"" received predominantly positive reviews from music critics. Several critics noted that the song's accompanying music video is a strong continuation of Minaj's sexually provocative style. Its chorus received several comparisons to the songs of Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams, and has been described ""raunchy, cheeky"" and a ""spitfire"", as well as ""the sexiest (if inadvertently) empowering song to hit the airwaves in a long time.""

USER: ",Cult film,"Cult film is a film that has acquired a small, but dedicated cult following. Some cult films are among the most popular, mainstream films of all time, such as The Godfather and Star Wars. However, there are thousands of other films that, due to their content or subject matter, do not fit into the commercial mainstream, but are recognisable to their audience. Films with cult followings usually have characteristics such as the following: a limited release, limited to only certain audiences, often only screened at film festivals and art houses; a ""cult of personality"" developed around a director, performer or production; and an identity formed around the film or central concept of the film that allows it to be a part of the cult. The terms cult classic, cult movie and cult film are often used interchangeably, although they can refer to different phenomena. The term ""cult classic"" usually refers to well-known non-franchise films that garnered a cult following after having a modest theatrical release or distribution. The term cult movie is less common, and in British English, refers primarily to B-movies and exploitative films.

USER: ",Blue-ringed octopus,"Blue-ringed octopus, are small octopuses common to shallow waters of the Indo-West Pacific. They can be found in Australia, South Africa, and parts of the Indian, Pacific, and Western Atlantic Oceans. They are known as the most toxic marine animal, as their saliva contains a paralyzing toxin that is effective upon contact. There is no known antivenom. Blue-ringed octopuses, like all octopuses, have poorly developed nervous systems and have no centralized nervous system or brain. They are relatively small animals, mature males reaching a mantle length of 10 cm. Juveniles are usually white or pale tan in color. Blue rings develop when blue pigment cells move from the suckers to the skin as the animal matures. Juveniles may have pink, brown, or blue-green rings. Females are larger than males, but there is little difference in shape. In the wild, blue-ringed octopuses have a lifespan of less than one year. Their main diet consists of small fish. They usually have a single venomous bite with two large chelate teeth. They use these two teeth to hold their food, then enlarge the area, injecting venom to kill the prey.

USER: ",Philip V of Spain,"Philip V of Spain (Spanish: Felipe V), known as Philip the Angry (Spanish: Felipe el Vivo), was King of Spain from 1 November 1700 to 9 July 1724, when he abdicated. The first person born outside of the Spanish Royal Family to become king, Philip was born in Paris to King Louis XIV of France and his new mistress, the Spanish Princess Maria Teresa. Due to his birth, he was named Duke of Anjou before he was called Philip by his family, the second son of King Louis XIV and his second wife, Maria Theresa of Spain. He was known in Spain as Philip V from 1700 onwards, although he did use his birth title Duc d'Anjou throughout his reign. Philip inherited the claim to the Spanish throne from his uncle, the infanta, Philip III of Spain, when he died childless in 1665. When his father Louis XIV of France began to consider his heir, Louis, Duke of Burgundy, in 1682, the prospect of the French invasion to put Louis ""on the Spanish throne"" caused a major international crisis in which England and the United Provinces fought on the anti-French side while the Empire, Savoy, and France itself opposed them. In 1684, Louis made overtures toward peace that were exploited by the English to force Louis XIV to promise to renounce any thought of putting his grandson in Spain. In 1688, a grandson of Charles II, Felipe of Anjou, was killed at sea during the fleet's return from an unsuccessful expedition to revive the Latin Empire in Constantinople. The death of the young man, who could have become Philip V of Spain, was an ironic twist of fate.

The French Open is the only Grand Slam that is played on clay, giving it a particular surface and atmosphere among the Grand Slams, although other tournaments are played on clay throughout the year. During the World War II, the tournament had to be suspended due to an outbreak of the war. After the war, Roland Garros, the club's president, and the USTLA (Union des Sociétés de Sports Athlétiques), a sporting organization set up in 1919, sought to restore the tournament. In August 1945, a committee of five members took place in the reconstruction of Paris to plan the recovery of Roland Garros and the French championship, which was to have been the last of the Grand Slam events played every year before the war, with the exception of a 1932 Wimbledon tournament.

USER: ",Romelu Lukaku,"Romelu Lukaku Bolingoli (born 13 May 1993) is a Belgian professional footballer who plays as a striker for Premier League club Everton and the Belgium national team. He is known for his strength, hold-up play, physicality and clinical finishing around the box, with a natural poaching instinct, enabling him to score goals from a wide variety of positions in and around the penalty area. After playing youth football in his native Belgium, in 2006, at the age of 13, Lukaku moved to England and joined the academy of Premier League side Everton, following advice from his parents to go and further his career. He had trials with Anderlecht and Fulham but chose to spend a year on loan at Anderlecht, where he played for the club's reserve team U.S. Virton instead. In July 2011, he was loaned to West Bromwich Albion, spending two years there, before joining Chelsea in July 2014 in a five-year contract worth £21 million. Lukaku was used sparingly during his first season at Chelsea, and later loaned at Everton, after failing to make an impact at the Premier League champions. He helped the club reach the Europa League semi-finals and the FA Cup final, scoring 16 goals in 36 matches. After a 74-goal haul split between Chelsea and Everton in 2016–17, he made a return to Everton for a fee of £75 million, signing a five-year contract that made him the third-most expensive player in British football, and the second-most-expensive striker.

USER: ",Republic of Ireland,"Republic of Ireland, also known informally as Ireland, is a group of islands situated in north-western Europe and occupying an area of north-western continental Europe that is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the west and north-west, the North Sea to the east, and the Irish Sea to the south and south-east. The country comprises five main islands—the island of Ireland, the largest; Inis Mór, Inis Meáin, Inis Oírr, and Inis Meán, the three of smallest; and Tory Island —and a few smaller isles. Nine countries and many overseas territories have claimed the island at one time or another. Of these nine, Ireland was the last to formally relinquish claims in 1938, from which it achieved independence and sovereignty from the United Kingdom and formed the modern, independent Republic of Ireland, with six of the island's 32 counties forming Northern Ireland and remaining within the United Kingdom. The island's geographical characteristics divide it into two distinct ecological and geological regions - a highly indented coastline on the western seaboard; and a largely uninterrupted east coast, containing low lying central plains with a high central region splitting the country almost equally. This central area features several extended upland ranges - Blackstairs Mountain, the Wicklow Mountains, as well as more isolated ranges such as the Ox Mountains, Mourne Mountains, and The Galtee Mountains.[2] The island's ecolocical divisions do not follow the jurisdictional divisions of the modern state and have resulted in the fragmented conservation and management of natural resource bodies relative to national boundaries.

USER: ",Celtic F.C.,"Celtic F.C. are a professional football club based in Glasgow, Scotland, which plays in the Scottish Premier League; their home ground is Celtic Park. Founded in 1888 with the purpose of alleviating poverty in the east end of Glasgow, the club's supporters, who are known as 'the Hoops', have enjoyed success in Scotland, winning the SPL an unprecedented 22 times, including a record eight straight titles between 2001 and 2008 and a sequence of seven titles in eight seasons between 1998 and 2005. Celtic have also won 37 Scottish Cups and 13 League Cups. In European football, the club have won two-thirds of all trophies available: the European Cup, now known as the UEFA Champions League, seven times (joint second-most with Real Madrid), and the European Cup Winners' Cup (now defunct) six times, more than any other European club. The club also has the European record for the most domestic 'trebles' (all three national trophies), and is the only British club to have won every national trophy available to them. The club's anthem is 'You'll Never Walk Alone'; this was the title of a Rodgers and Hammerstein song in the musical Carousel, which was the club's theme song in its early years. Celtic fans hold their own European record having supported their team every minute of every Champions League match in the competition since their first appearance in 1966. Celtic have a large overseas support, due to their huge European record, despite the fact that they are the only British team from south of the border to play in the Scottish league. They hold the record of European football's biggest away following—in a UEFA Cup match against Torino in 1989 a Celtic crowd of 6,000 came despite the game taking place in Torino on the occasion of the local Carnival celebrations.

He was the only president to resign the presidency, although he was never been charged with or convicted of a crime. His participation in the Watergate scandal eventually led to resign from office. Nixon's reputation also came under attack following the revelation in 2001 of long-secret White House tape recordings from his tenure as President. The tapes were found in an electronic vault and are evidence of White House involvement in the Watergate scandal, which is the reason Nixon was impeached and resigned.

USER: ",Edward VIII,"Edward VIII abdicated the throne of the United Kingdom in the winter of 1936, prior to his coronation, to marry Wallis Simpson, a divorced American, instead of the first choice of the British Constitution, Wallis Warfield Simpson. Simpson wanted to marry the king, who would only have married her if he had been free to marry whomsoever he wished. As King George VI and his wife Queen Elizabeth did not approve his marriage to Wally, the king eventually chose between abdicating from the throne, or marrying and alienating his wife from him and their son, Albert. He and Simpson married on the seventh of December 1936. Edward remained king for less than a year, from his birthday (3 November) of 1936 until his abdication at 57 to succeed to the throne on 11 December 1936; the abdication caused a constitutional crisis with the succession to the throne passing over Prince George, Duke of Kent, whose mother was a first cousin of the monarch; Edward abdicated in order to marry the divorced Wallis Simpson. He later, upon the demise of George VI, became Duke of Windsor. His reign was the shortest in British history.

USER: ",Modern liberalism in the United States,"Modern liberalism in the United States is a political philosophy that combines philosophical liberalism with social liberalism, centering on a commitment to individual equality and social justice that has led to government intervention in the economy to promote individual and social freedom. The United States developed in a liberal political tradition dating from its origins in the 18th Century with the Founding Fathers and the Bill of Rights. It continued into the 19th and 20th centuries with prominent philosophies such as Progressivism, the New Deal, and Social Security. Today, a political philosophy is often characterized as liberal if it advocates economic freedom, individual rights, constitutionalism, rule of law, and the separation of government and religion. Though these principles are shared by a variety of different political positions, the combination of these principles in a philosophy that advocates a free market place, an activist government, social justice, and individual freedom is a particular liberal tradition.

The 1995 book Doctor Who: A Celebration of Monsters by Marcus Hearn recognised eighty-eight of these as ""Monsters of the week"".

In the modern era, the term has often been used as a way to differentiate moderate left-wing policies from the more radical left. However, the political leanings of liberals differ from those of leftists who support more progressive policies. Liberals in the United States have come to support universal public education, a mixed economy based on private property through limited liability, anti-trust, and progressive income taxes.

The third son of Leopold I of Belgium, King of the Belgians, and of Louise-Marie, Duchess of Parma, he succeeded to the throne at the age of 30, in a time when Belgium enjoyed territorial, economic and great societal advancements. However, after a decade on the throne, he began a policy of intransigence that would lead to the deaths of tens of thousands of Congolese people—an event referred to as the Congo Massacre. His reign was plagued with difficulties, but especially his private policy of imperialism in the Congo Free State. It has been suggested that Leopold's personal motto, Inter arma enim silent musae, in times of war, the arts fall silent, was the impetus behind his Congo Free State venture.

The band enjoyed international success with their 1973 album The Dark Side of the Moon, containing the hit single ""Money"" as well as ""Time"", which remained as one of the album's most popular pieces (the latter of which also became the de facto anthem for the NASA space program). In 1975, cofounder, vocalist, and guitarist Syd Barrett departed due to deteriorating mental health, and the band hired guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour. Wider fame and critical success continued through the 1970s, but another album, Animals (1977), fractured the relationship between the band and its record company, EMI.

It is sometimes called Earth's ""sister planet"" because of their similar size (about 95% of Earth's size) and orbital period (about eight years). It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. The planet Venus is the second planet from the Sun, and the sixth largest. The Venusian year is longer than Earth's, 224.7 days. Like its sister planet, Earth, Venus is a terrestrial world, but unlike Earth it lacks large water oceans. Instead, it has an extremely thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide, whose pressure at the planet's surface is approximately 90 times that of Earth's. Venus's atmosphere is the densest of the four planets in the Solar System and the composition of its atmosphere is such that the planet surface has a temperature of 470 kelvins. Its atmospheric pressure is 92 times that of Earth—approximately equivalent to the pressure found 900 m below the surface of the Earth at sea level.

Its chief claim to fame as a tourist attraction is its small but notable museum containing some of the finest statues from ancient Chalcidice. The city was most likely founded in the early Classical period, somewhere between the late 6th and 4th centuries BC, during the early years of the Greek colonisation of Chalcidice. After its destruction by Philip II of Macedon, about 340 BC, the city had to wait until the Hellenistic period before recovering, growing prosperous with an active commercial port and an excellent harbor. This came to a halt when Stagira was conquered by the Romans and included into the Roman province of Macedonia.

USER: ",United States,"United States of America. A federal republic comprising fifty states and a federal district; population 308,745,538; capital, Washington DC The land area is 9,631,418 sq km. There is little evidence that prehistoric peoples inhabited the eastern area that became the United States; instead, this land served in part as a pathway for people migrating from Asia. It was explored by British and French explorers from 1583. The English and the French struggled for control of different parts of the region in the 17th century, including the coastal region. English settlement in the region increased, with the first permanent English settlement (Plymouth, Massachusetts) and subsequent colonies being founded in 1620. At the time, the land was controlled in large parts by European monarchies, notably the French and the Spanish; the French and Indian War marked the first major European conflict for control of the territory later to be known at the United States and ultimately the British victory over France resulted in the region becoming part of the British Empire. The American Revolution was a turning point for the colonies in the war for independence from Britain, resulting in the formation of the United States. The United States took over from the British and Spanish control of many territories, notably Louisiana in 1803. The Oregon territory was eventually purchased from Great Britain and Russia. Slaves were brought to America in the early years of colonisation, particularly in the south, and were used heavily in some states. During the 1800s, the states of the Americas grew in population and power, leading to a series of conflicts (including the American Civil War) before unity was eventually established by the 1860s. The two world wars involved large amounts of population. As a superpower in the second half of the 20th century, the United States was significantly involved in the Cold War with the Soviet Union. The United States helped establish NATO and supported other alliances and military actions in Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America. The United States is a federal constitutional republic in the form of a direct democracy and has a strong, mixed capitalist economy focused primarily on industrial production and service. It is also one of the world's leading exporters. A large majority of Americans identify"

USER: ",Hypothyroidism,"Hypothyroidism is a disorder of metabolism in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough of the thyroid hormone. It is caused by an underactive (hypo) thyroid gland. The thyroid gland is a butterfly shaped organ that sits in the front of the neck. It manufactures thyroid hormones, which regulate the rate at which the body’s cells work; they influence heart rate, body temperature, and weight, among other things. Low thyroid levels in the blood are called hypothyroidism. When patients have this condition, they are usually mildly hypothyroid and have an enlarged thyroid gland. Hypothyroidism has two main forms: inadequate production of thyroid hormone by the gland and excessive breakdown of thyroid hormone by the body. Hyperthyroidism refers to the opposite problem, in which the thyroid gland makes too much thyroid hormone.

USER: ",Vedanta,"Vedanta literally means ""the end of the Vedas,"" and refers to the philosophical conclusion or pinnacle of the knowledge taught by the Vedas, the ancient religious texts of Hinduism. Hindu philosophers disagreed on who was the original teacher of the Upanishads, but most consider the ancient Indian sage Śvetaketu to be the first to teach them. The Upanishads are found in Hinduism's scripture, the Prasthanatrayi. The Upanishads are among the most ancient texts in Indian philosophy: of the roughly 400 known Upanishads, the earliest dates to roughly 800 BC. The oldest among these are from Atharva Veda, but the main body of Upanishads are connected with the Brahmanas and the oldest part of the Samhitas, and with the earliest layers of Vedic tradition (which emerges from Rig Veda Samhita) and with Hindu ascetic traditions going back over 3000 years. They form a significant and foundational part of Hinduism's philosophy and are also cited as a major influence on many schools of Vedantic philosophies.

USER: ",Prison Break,"Prison Break is an American television serial drama created by Paul Scheuring for FOX that was broadcast in the United States from 2005 to 2009. The series revolves around two brothers, Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell) and Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller), who escape prison and form a daring plan to break their wrongful imprisonment by using Michael's specialist knowledge to create a seemingly-impossible plan on how to do so. Meanwhile, Lincoln's brother A.D. Biller (Mark Feuerstein) is sent to foil the plan by breaking into the prison, while the rest of the series is dedicated to the two brothers and their efforts to remain free while on the run from both those who sent them to prison and also those sent to bring them back. Each season contains a cliffhanger that often leaves the audience with a big question, which drives the next season and the following episodes in that season. The series is produced by Adelstein/Parouse Entertainment, DreamWorks, 20th Century Fox Television and Wonderland Sound and Vision. The pilot episode premiered in the United States on October 9, 2005. Fox broadcast the first three seasons of the show on Tuesday nights. Midway through the third season, the schedule was changed to a Thursday night slot. Due to the show's performance in the ratings, Fox decided, after four seasons, to cancel Prison Break. However, on April 5, 2008, Fox Entertainment president Kevin Reilly announced via Twitter that Prison Break has been revived due to popular demand. During the revival season, it aired from April 1, to August 21, 2009. A fourth season consisting of fourteen episodes was later announced, though FOX announced later that it was the final season. Seasons one to three, as well as the final fourteenth season, became available on Netflix in March and April 2018. Prison Break is popular in Eastern Europe, where it airs on Fox Crime, and it will be aired on AXN, an English language channel of Astro in Malaysia.

USER: ",Ronald Reagan,"Ronald Reagan (1911–2004) was the 40th President of the United States (1981–89) and the 33rd governor of California (1967–75). He was a conservative politician, serving in the White House from 1981 to 1989. Reagan was the Democratic Party nominee for governor of California in 1966, but lost the election to incumbent Republican Governor Edmund G. ""Pat"" Brown. The loss prompted him to switch political parties. In 1968, Reagan was selected as the Republican Presidential nominee. He was elected as president in a landslide in 1980. Reagan relied on his expert communication abilities and persuaded the country to believe in the necessity of high defense spending despite record-high defense budgets. Reaganomics was the name for his proposed series of federal tax cuts and other economic policies which he believed would lead to higher growth and reduce unemployment. He ended the remaining economic stimulus programs of Jimmy Carter's administration, such as the Flexible Price Adjustment Plan, and made changes in the tax code. Reaganomics and Reagan's personal optimism strengthened the country's economy to the point that it began to rebound in the first few years of his presidency. He was re-elected in 1984, defeating former Vice President Walter Mondale in a landslide.

In this manner, Hendrix was inspired to write one of his most popular and well-known songs. On the recording of the song, the intro consists of Hendrix playing a two note riff, which is a descending octave followed by ascending half steps. This was done on his Fender Stratocaster and was one of few songs recorded by Hendrix that did not require extensive changes to be played on stage by Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding. Due to the success of the album, later recordings were made by Hendrix using backing music by The American Experience Band, who recorded the song using an organ. There were also a number of bootlegs released using the backing music from the Are You Experienced album.

USER: ",Rock music,"Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated in the United States in the 1950s. The roots of rock music are in blues and rhythm and blues music. Rock music also drew on the guitar, bass, and drums instrumentation used in blues, together with a strong back beat (a rhythm on the off-beat) and a shouted, stylised vocal style. Rock developed as a rebellion against the dominance of the older ""parent"" genres, such as rhythm and blues, jazz, and country. Along with the beat, guitar, bass, and drums, rock music often incorporates three other instrument families in various combinations: the brass (xylophones, trombones, trumpets), the woodwind (clarinets, saxophones), and the analog synthesizer keyboards, especially electronic organs.

USER: ","Performance (film), Mick Jagger, Mick Jagger","Performance (film) is a 1970 British film directed by Nicolas Roeg and starring James Fox and Mick Jagger. The screenplay, written by Donald Cammell and written with Nicholas Roeg, was semi-autobiographical regarding actor James Fox's affair with Anita Pallenberg, who was also Jagger's companion at the time.

Performance was highly controversial in both Europe and the United States. It was banned in Ireland, and the American distributor was arrested under obscenity charges, which were eventually dropped. The film is frequently credited with influencing the emergence of the gonzo sub-genre of film-making in the United States during the early 1970s.
