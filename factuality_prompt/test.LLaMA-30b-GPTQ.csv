USER: ",Usain Bolt,"Usain Bolt will go down in history as the most successful male Olympian of all time, and for good reason — the Jamaican athlete has been dominating the sport he loves since his breakout performance at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, where he became the first athlete to win three gold medals in a single Olympic track meet since Carl Lewis in 1984. He's the second fastest human of all time, the first being his own world-record time — he took his eighth career Olympic gold medal in Rio last summer by smashing yet another record (but maybe not for long if he has anything to say about it).

The news may be distributed in hard copy, e-paper, on the Internet, or may be available as an electronic audiovisual display. News (and its delivery) may also be actively distributed, as in the case of an infopod, a similar device used by a fictional mid-21st century society in the television series Max Headroom to disseminate news to the general public. Also (more recently) known as the ""hard copy"". This has not replaced the ""hard copy"" due to the inherent distrust of electronic sources of information and the lack of quality control in classic, hard-copy media.

In 1998, Damon's next big-budget project was Steven Spielberg's World War II drama Saving Private Ryan.

Worthy to be mentioned that the other two movies, Adjusted and Dogma, performed well in the box office. He played an everyman in the former, and a fallen angel in the latter.

USER: ",Social anxiety disorder,"Social anxiety disorder, also known as social phobia, is an anxiety disorder in which a person has excessive and disabling fear or anxiety in social situations, but not in specific phobic contexts. These situations may include talking with or engaging in social communication with others, being observed or inhibiting his or her behavior because of perceived scrutiny, or in general performance situations. The disorder may be so severe that affected people go to great lengths to avoid certain types of social interaction. Some sources equate social anxiety disorder with shyness and reticence. However, in socially anxious individuals, the underlying anxiety is not necessarily a response to anything in particular, but an overwhelming worry, fear and expectation of disruption from the social environment.

USER: ",Led Zeppelin,"Led Zeppelin were an English rock band formed in London in 1968. The group consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. The group's heavy, guitar-driven sound, rooted in blues and psychedelia on their early albums, has drawn them recognition as one of the progenitors of heavy metal, though their unique style drew from a wide variety of influences, including folk music. After changing their name from the New Yardbirds, the group signed to Atlantic Records and released their eponymous debut album. Led Zeppelin's fourth album, which featured the track ""Stairway to Heaven"", is among the most popular and influential works in rock music, and it cemented the popularity of the group. Subsequent recording sessions for their follow-up album Physical Graffiti (1975) were disrupted by Bonham's declining health, as he suffered from poor dietary habits, insomnia, and excessive consumption of alcohol. He died of pulmonary asphyxiation on 20 September 1980, after inhaling his own vomit, a result of ingesting 40% alcohol.

Charles was the second son of King James VI of Scotland, but after his father inherited the English throne in 1603, he moved to England to begin a new life there. He became heir apparent to the throne when his brother, Henry Frederick, died and he inherited the throne in 1625 following the death of his father. His early years, particularly his personal rule of Scotland, were spent in unrest and a struggle with the Presbyterian forms of worship favoured by the Scottish kirk. Civil wars known as the Bishops' Wars raged in England and Scotland between 1637 and 1640 in his efforts to enforce traditional liturgical forms. A growing civil war in England, known as the English Civil War, led to his execution in 1649.[25]

USER: ","Ken Russell, Tommy (1975 film)","Ken Russell, CBE, HRGS, (3 March 1927 – 27 November 2011) was an English film director, television director and screenwriter generally classified as a British filmmaker, although he was born in Southampton, England and made the first part of his career in a country of which he was proud. Russell's films in the late 1960s and early 1970s were partly atypical of the British film industry, being lavish, idiosyncratic, and in some instances extremely violently or sexually explicit. He was always ready to experiment with editing, style and narrative structure, and to make non-linear, subjective, multi-view cinematic expression a means of investigating both cinematic techniques and the film's subject matter. He often used shooting techniques that were derived not only from his experimental documentaries but also from cinéma vérité, such as in his documentary A Kew Gardens and the shot in the feature film Altered States where Sally Field is seen by her husband walking on water. His films during these formative phases contained many pop-art style effects including a dream-like narrative structure, direct address (breaking the fourth wall) through voiceover, elliptical and often fragmented editing, shockingly violent or sexual imagery and a juxtaposition of soundtrack styles.

Most distilled spirits contain liquor produced for mixing, and so are not produced from 100% of their base substance. Tequila is also the base of a wide variety of mixed drinks, among the best-known is the margarita.

Most of the damage happened in three days, the beginning of the week of February 27, 1989, after the government increased the cost of gasoline and public transportation fares. The Caracazo left an immeasurable impact on Venezuelan society. Many Venezuelans who lived through the Caracazo saw themselves as victims of a new social and political elite who exploited them for political and economic reasons. Many Venezuelans now feel that the country was unjustly used as a foreign entity’s instrument to exploit people and resources. Some believe that the Caracazo contributed to the rise of Hugo Chávez and his administration.

The modern United States was formed in 1789, following a war between states in the 1780s, when delegates of the Thirteen Colonies met in what became known as the Second Continental Congress.

Dahmer was born in the city of West Allis, Wisconsin, in Milwaukee County on May 21, 1960. He was raised in a nominally Lutheran family. He was the first of two sons of Lionel Raymond Dahmer, an electrical engineer at Marquette Electronics and shipping dispatcher of the same company, and Joyce Annette Dahmer (née Joyce Annette Flint), a one-time church-choir singer. Dahmer was raised with his brother, David, and mother, Joyce. Dahmer was described as a high-functioning alcoholic with mood swings by those who knew him. He drank heavily, was drunk for much of the day, and was hostile when intoxicated. There was much discussion within the family about Lionel Dahmer's alcoholism, and his inability to keep a job due to his temper. Joyce tried to keep their social standing so that she would not be embarrassed. This included hanging on to any job so that his alcoholism would not be known. There are many speculations of Lionel and young Jeffrey getting into an accident when Jeffrey was 5 in which it is rumored he killed his father when it happened. Jeffrey also did not get along with his brother David at a young age, as Jeffrey did not approve of David's long hair and choice in music.

It was released in 1970 and was a product of the collaboration between Donald Cammell and Nicolas Roeg. Performance can be viewed as an attempt to explore the border between fantasy and reality in the mind. Critic Roger Ebert was disturbed by the film: ""Performance is a difficult film, and not simply because it's a poor copy of Fellini... No, the problem is that the movie takes itself so seriously. It's a bad mistake to build a psychedelic picture around such pedestrian material as gangsters, porn stars and drug addicts, and to fall head over heels into the fantasies of the stoned mind, and to make Mick Jagger the symbol of our incipient apocalypse just because he had a haircut and sold a few records to young people who went on to make the world a slightly more interesting place to live in. If Performance had been made about something serious, something real, it might have had more meaning"".
