However, the company's rapid expansion saw it drop the ""Kentucky"" from its name in 1991, and ultimately Sanders was bought out by PepsiCo.

USER: ",Elvis Presley,"Elvis Presley (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977) was an American singer and actor. Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as ""the King of Rock and Roll"", or simply, ""the King"". Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, when he began to work with Sam Phillips, the owner of Sun Records. Accompanied by guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, Presley was an early popularizer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage the singer for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, ""Heartbreak Hotel"", released in January 1956, was a number-one hit. He became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll with a series of network television appearances and chart-topping records. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines that coincided with the dawn of the Civil Rights Movement, made him enormously popular—and controversial.

The wars were a result of a combination of factors, including the weak rule of the House of Lancaster, the House of York's claim to the throne, and the inability of the English aristocracy to come to an agreement on who should rule. The wars were fought in several battles, including the Battle of St Albans, the Battle of Towton, and the Battle of Bosworth Field. The Wars of the Roses ended with the victory of the House of York and the accession of King Henry VII to the throne.

USER: ",Rock music,"Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated in the United States in the 1950s. It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll, a style which drew heavily on the genres of blues, rhythm and blues, and from country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources. Musically, rock has centered on the electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with electric bass, drums, and one or more singers. Typically, rock is song-based music usually with a 4/4 time signature using a verse–chorus form, but the genre has become extremely diverse. Like pop music, lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political.

It is located at the junction of the East and South China Seas in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, with the People's Republic of China (PRC) to the northwest, Japan to the northeast, and the Philippines to the south. The island of Taiwan has an area of 35,808 square kilometres (13,826 sq mi), with mountain ranges dominating the eastern two-thirds and plains in the western third, where its highly urbanised population is concentrated. Its capital and largest city is Taipei. It administers the Pescadores and the Matsu Islands. In addition to calling Taiwan a country, the ROC also refers to itself as ""Taiwan"", after its largest island. The Republic of China was originally based in mainland China until losing the Chinese Civil War in 1949 to the Communist Party of China, which established the People's Republic of China (PRC) on the mainland. The ROC government fled to Taiwan and made Taipei its temporary capital. The political status of Taiwan is disputed. Shortly after the ROC lost control of mainland China, the United Nations gave the Chinese seat on the Security Council and other UN organs to the PRC. In 1971, the PRC replaced the ROC as the sole representative of China in the UN and as one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.
